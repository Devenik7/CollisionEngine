# CollisionEngine

My experiments on making a basic Physics 2D Collision Engine.
This version includes a p5.js file which a javascript visualisation library and this file is necessary for some of the function used. Although this can be easily mitigated by modifying those functions (i.e., ellipse, fill etc.,) with your own version.
For ease, just include the file as well

As of it's intial versions, this collision engine can be used to resolve collision between two objects. 
The objects can be of type "Circle" or "Rectangle".

The object classes have been specified. If you wan tyour own custom object classes. Follow the original files and look for the          "// compulsory" tags which specify the necessary data members that need to be present in the final objects that will be used the collision engine.
